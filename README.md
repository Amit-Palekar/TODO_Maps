# TODO Maps

### Inspiration
To help kids and adults to stay active and help plan workouts in a fun and productive manner, to keep bodies and the earth healthy!!!

### What it does
Plans out a run for the user, helping them stay active and fit. Helps bolster health and physical activity, helping people get out of their cars and staying active. The user can choose a specified mode of transportation from a drop down menu, and then choose a destination or specific distance they want to travel. The app will generate a path and journey for the user to take. When a user inputs a specified distance, the app will generate a route with 2 checkpoints, all 1/3 of the initial distance away from each other. This is created to help reward the user when he/she passes by these checkpoints, helping them achieve a sort of mental boost on their journey. These attributes all help to create a efficient and pleasant user experience, helping motivate and reinforce this idea of physical activity and not using a gas alternative.

### What's next?
More capabilities, we can develop the app to have abilities for tracking user data to help provide an individual user experience, and to further expand into machine learning. Also, added capabilities in calculating steepness and gradient of runs and biking trips, to effectively calculate the difficulty of a run or biking trip.
